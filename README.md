# python
Repository of the various projects I have undertaken in python, mainly for machine learning and data analysis
- **association_rules** (25 Oct 2018): this directory contains code using apyori and mlxtend's libraries to perform association rule analytics on a dataset (which I also left in the directory)
- **phishing_site_spammer** (29 Oct 2018): this directory contains code that allows you to flood a phishing website with bad randomly-generated data in order to create confusion for the scammers
- **network_intrusion_detection** (29 Oct 2018): this directory contains code that was created for an academic project at IUPUI. I wrote python code to train a DecisionTreeClassifier and the test using the testing data to predict network intrusions. It was 100% accurate, however it would have been more beneficial to have received more data.
