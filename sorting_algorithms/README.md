Sorting Algorithms in Python
---

Learned the algorithms from here: https://medium.com/@george.seif94/a-tour-of-the-top-5-sorting-algorithms-with-python-code-43ea9aa02889

My files are very close to what is in the Medium article, however I comment every line and use more descriptive variable names to help me learn
(and anyone else who stumbles upon this repository to help them as well)

Files in this Directory:
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Time Comparison - Load up 2000 random integers and have the algorithm sort and see the times for each run.
