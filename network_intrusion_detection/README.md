##Network Intrusion Detection
In my Big Data Analytics (CIT 49900) class at IUPUI, we were tasked with creating a 
model to classify or cluster data regarding network intrustion detection. 
We were given a subset of the 1999 kddcup network intrusion dataset (not included, not sure on licensing)
for analysis. Our group decided on the features and then I was tasked with writing the model to classify
a set of training and test data. In this repository is a report on our findings and results to help dissect
the code. Also in this repo is the information that was exported at various stages,
such as the scatter plot, decision tree and results of the model (which was 100% accurate)
